                    location of the shrine to the Sindhi Sufi poet, Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, who came to be called Bhittai on account

                    Rani Bagh is a fascinating subplot in the history of Mumbai. It was established at Byculla in 1861 by the
                Agri-Horticultural Society of Western India as Victoria Gardens and in 1890, a small zoo was added to it. Long before
                iconic heritage structures like the Victoria Terminus and Gateway of India, there was Rani Bagh.</p>
