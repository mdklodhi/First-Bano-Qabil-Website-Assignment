        Neroon Kot. Hyderabad city is rich in culture, traditions and history due to the fact that it lies alongside the
        River Indus. This city used to be renowned as the “Paris of India” due to the belief that the streets of the
        city were washed each morning with clean drinking water from the River Indus. Hyderabad now is a significant
        commercial and cultural center and serves as the passage between the rural and urban Sindh. A visitor coming to
