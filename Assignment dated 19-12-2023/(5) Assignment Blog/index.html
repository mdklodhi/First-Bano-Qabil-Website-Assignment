                    A blog post is the piece of content in a blog. Posts are frequently updated and often organized in
                    reverse chronological
                    order with the newest blog post appearing at the top.

                    Each post covers a subtopic of the blog and links back to the blog itself. For instance, blog site
                    Engadget focuses
                    primarily on technology news and reviews of consumer electronics. Each blog post covers a specific
                    piece of electronic
                    or technology news. But posts on the site also cover topics adjacent to electronics, such as movies
                    and other forms of
                    entertainment that overlap with the tech space. For example, one post looks at a movie dramatization
                    of the popular
                    video game chain GameStop.

                    Bloggers use their posts to attract audiences and rank high on search engine results. Business blog
                    posts are often used
                    at the beginning of the sales funnel that describes a product buyer's journey. They serve as an
                    audience's introduction
                    to a business and its products. Bloggers can use these posts to build content around more keywords
                    and topical trends
                    that audiences are searching for and turn those visitors into customers..</p>

                <img src="./Images/blog_structure-f.png" height=500 alt="Post 2 Image">
                <p><i>Basic Blog Structure Are as folowing:</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Share views and connect with an audience</b>
                        <p>Blogs provide many writers and thought leaders with an outlet to share information and their
                            views with a wide audience. Instead of relying on publications to publish their content or
                            write about their business, individuals and businesses communicate directly with their
                            audience. Blogging is an effective way to raise awareness about a subject or product and to
                            build an online community around it.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Build a business and sell products.</b>
                        <p>Blogging is a popular practice for businesses trying to gain credibility in their industries,
                            build high search engine rankings, connect with a target audience and identify sales leads.
                            Using search engine optimization (SEO) strategies, blog content can turn a business blog
                            into an authority on a technology or market. In this way, a business can reach a wide
                            audience that regularly visits or links to its website and buys its products.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Raise awareness</b>
                        <p>Blogs are an effective way to raise awareness about issues and causes, and to influence
                            public and government opinion. Many nonprofit organizations use blogs to build social and
                            political campaigns that inform audiences about a topic and keep them engaged in that
                            topic's development.</p>

                Blogs were originally called weblogs, which were websites that consisted of a series of entries
                arranged in reverse chronological order, so the newest posts appeared at the top. They were
                frequently updated with new information about various topics.

                Today's blogs are more likely to be a personal online journal or commentary related to a business
                that's frequently updated and intended for general public consumption. Blogs are still often defined
                by their format, consisting of a series of entries posted to a single page in reverse chronological
                order. Many blogs are collaborative and include multiple authors often writing on a single theme
                such as Engadget, a tech blog with multiple authors.</p>
